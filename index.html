  <p><div>The Annapolis, a retired Canadian Destroyer, was sunk on April 2015 as an artificial reef. On this dive, we worked tightening the mooring lines and cleaning the deco cage. After we were done with the work, we went all around and underneath the ship.</div></p>

 <h1 style="font-family: 'Rock Salt', cursive;">Turtles Offshore Makena</h1>
  <p><div>We found a site with many turtles vying to get a spot on the reef so that they can get cleaned. Eventually turtles have to go back to the surface to breath. The number of individuals in this site made it interesting and dynamic as some were leaving their spot to take a breath while others were coming back down sometimes to find their spot is occupied.</div></p>
