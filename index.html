 <h1><div style="font-family: Raleway, sans-serif;"Turtles Offshore Makena</div></h1>
  <p>We found a site with many turtles vying to get a spot on the reef so that they can get cleaned. Eventually turtles have to go back to the surface to breath. The number of individuals in this site made it interesting and dynamic as some were leaving their spot to take a breath while others were coming back down sometimes to find their spot is occupied.</p>
